      <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
       <!--<img src="" alt="Wow, what a good looking fella.">-->
        I am a Computer Science graduate from South City St. Louis, Missouri. I have a passion for all things computers, IT, and networking.
        Solving strange problems and creating cool services is what makes me tick. I am a programmer, musician, team-player, and occasional athlete.    
    </p>
    <p>
        I've been the "computer guy" for as long as I can remember.

        <!--<img src="" alt="Bishop DuBourg Jazz Band @ DuBourg Guild Theatre">-->
        I've been tought music since I could talk, and I began playing music during my sophomore year at Bishop DuBourg High School,
        and joined the Jazz band senior year. I got involved with the IT department, where I got my first taste of Windows Server and Active Directory
        management. 
    </p>
    <p title="I also know ActionScript but nobody uses Adobe Flash anymore so that's basically useless.">
        I have experence in C++, Java, JavaScript, and HTML as well as beginner's knowledge in Ruby. As for Cybersecurity work, I've extensively used
        Burp Suite and many CLI tools for application auditing.
